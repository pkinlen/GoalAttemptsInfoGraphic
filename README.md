# GoalAttemptsInfoGraphic

A football game has come to and end and we have the data on the number of shots taken by each team that 
were on target and the number that were misses. If we want to present that in a nice graphic, 
we could display it like a goal, with the area in the goal representing the number of shots on target 
and the area outside to represent the misses. The graphic is divided into a left and right section, 
one for each team. 
If you're interested in the mathematics behind the calculation, then have a look at
